## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

1. React Functional Components.
2. UseState Hook.
3. State and Props.
4. Javascript conditional (ternary) operator.
5. isNaN function.
6. CSS Grid. 
7. Mobile first design approach.

### Continued development

I have learnt so much after this project, however, there are still concepts that I am still not completely comfortable with. Areas I'd like to continue focusing on in future projects:

1. CSS Grid.
2. Refine on useState Hook, State and Props.
3. More organized approach for styling different components and media query.

### Useful resources

- [Dev Ed Youtube Chanel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH1_YtUTSQ) - This helped me learn about State and Props. Ed is an amazing teacher! I'd recommend this channel for anyone still learning this concept.
